# OpenCV Exercises

## Goal
    
The purpose of writing these codes is to learn and practice the Python OpenCV library.
In order to make this code easy to read and understand, it has been tried to be written in accordance with the python coding style guidelines and clean code techniques.

## Development
While preparing this repository, OpenCV documentation and [freeCodeCamp.org Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ) were used.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6
- OpenCV 2

## How to Use 
Once you clone the repository, you can run samples with Python 3.6+

Create a virtual environment;
`python3 -m venv .env`

Run following command to install all requirements;
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

The input images and codes used for the code to work properly must be in **the same folder**.

If you want to import your own input images, you can also use your own input images. 

Make sure that the new images must be the same as the names in code files.

## Code Files

### `bitwise_operations.py`
### `canny_threshold.py`
### `data_visualization.py`
### `drawing_rectangle.py`
### `filtering_blurring.py`
### `rotation.py`
### `template_matching.py`


## Road Map 
In fact, I wanted to pass input file paths as arguments to scripts, but I haven't finished yet.
